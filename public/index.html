Node.js OAuth example

Read the blog post here

This is an example node application that implements Githubs OAuth2 API.

In order to run the application:

    Register your new application on Github : https://github.com/settings/applications/new. In the "callback URL" field, enter "http://localhost:8080/oauth/redirect". Once you register, you will get a client ID and client secret.
    Replace the values of the clientID and clientSecret variables in the index.js file
    Install dependencies by executing: npm install or yarn.
    Start the server by executing node index.js
    Navigate to http://localhost:8080 on your browser.
